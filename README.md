We propose the powerful end-to-end deep learning model for rain-streak removal on a single rain LFI, by decompsing it into rain-free LFI and rain-streak LFI with mist/veiling. At same time, we construct the first rainy light-field dataset, consisting of both synthetic real-world-like LFIs and real-world LFIs for training and evaluation.
